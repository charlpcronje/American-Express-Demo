# Future Architecture Options & Recommendations

> [Back to README](./README.html)

This document outlines possible strategies for building and scaling your dashboard component ecosystem, considering your technical constraints and long-term flexibility. Each option is described with its pros, cons, and technical implications. Two additional ideas from best practices are included at the end.

---

## Constraints
- **Razor templates** will continue to be used for integrating data into templates.
- The solution must not break or replace existing Razor-based data flows.

---

## 1. Online Component Library with Theming API

**Description:**
- Host all reusable UI components in an online library (npm, CDN, or private server).
- Razor templates reference these components directly (via script/module imports or as web components).
- Theming and configuration are passed as props or attributes (JSON, data-attributes, or inline config).
- All business logic is kept outside the components; components are purely presentational.

**Pros:**
- Centralizes design and logic; updates propagate everywhere.
- Easy to enforce theming and branding.
- Components can be versioned and documented.
- No business logic in UI layer—separation of concerns.

**Cons:**
- Requires robust versioning and deployment strategy.
- Razor integration may need wrapper helpers for seamless use.
- Some learning curve for non-JS developers.

**Use When:**
- You want maximum reusability and central governance of UI components.

## 2. XML + XSLT Component Transformation

**Description:**
- Dashboards/pages are authored in XML, describing layout and data.
- XSLT transforms XML into HTML using component tags, injecting data as needed.
- Components are pulled in from a library server as needed.
- Data is loaded into components via XSLT or post-processing.

**Pros:**
- Elegant separation of data/content (XML) and presentation (XSLT/components).
- Can be managed by non-JS developers and designers.
- Versioned, auditable templates.
- XSLT can be run server-side or client-side.

**Cons:**
- XSLT expertise required (rare skill).
- Debugging can be more complex.
- Tooling and browser support for XSLT is limited.
- May be harder to integrate with modern JS frameworks.

**Use When:**
- You want a clear separation of data and presentation, and have XML/XSLT expertise.

---

## 3. Web Components via LitElement + React Wrappers

**Description:**
- Build core UI as [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) using LitElement (or similar).
- Publish these as a library (npm, CDN, or private server).
- Use lightweight React wrappers to enable reactivity and integration with existing React code.
- Razor templates reference web components as custom tags.

**Pros:**
- True framework-agnostic components (usable in React, Angular, Vue, Razor, etc.).
- Can be loaded as custom elements anywhere.
- React wrappers can provide hooks, state, and advanced logic.
- Easy to share across teams and codebases.

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex build and testing setup.
- Some edge cases with React <-> Web Component event communication.
- Not all legacy browsers support Web Components natively (but polyfills exist).

**Use When:**
- You want maximum flexibility and future-proofing for your component library.

---

## 4. XMLT-Driven Web Components (No-JS Authoring)

**Description:**
- Authors write dashboards using custom XML tags (representing components).
- XMLT (XML Transformation Tool) converts these tags into actual web components at build or runtime.
- Components are loaded from a protected library server (CORS-restricted).
- All JS is loaded only as needed, and only by authorized users.

**Pros:**
- Enables non-JS authors to build dashboards using custom tags.
- JS is protected and only loaded for authorized clients.
- Centralized component control and versioning.
- Can integrate with existing Razor data flows by transforming tags server-side.

**Cons:**
- Requires custom tooling (XMLT, server-side transforms, etc.).
- Debugging and error tracing can be tricky.
- Still requires solid documentation and onboarding.

**Use When:**
- You want to empower non-JS authors and tightly control JS usage.

---

## 5. (AI Suggestion) Micro-Frontend Architecture with Module Federation

**Description:**
- Each dashboard or major feature is a separate micro-frontend (React, Razor, or other), loaded dynamically via [Webpack Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
- Shared components are exposed as federated modules from a central library.
- Each team can deploy independently, but share a common UI language.

**Pros:**
- Enables independent deployment, scaling, and versioning.
- Shared components are loaded only when needed.
- Works with any frontend stack (React, Razor, etc.).

**Cons:**
- Increased build/deployment complexity.
- Requires careful dependency management and CI/CD setup.

**Use When:**
- You want to scale development across multiple teams and dashboards.

---

## 6. (AI Suggestion) Server-Driven UI via JSON Schema

**Description:**
- Dashboards are described as JSON schemas (or similar config), specifying layout, component types, theming, and data sources.
- A universal renderer (React, web components, or Razor helper) reads the schema and renders the appropriate components.
- All business logic, data fetching, and theming is handled outside the component library.

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility and decoupling.
- Dashboards can be built/modified without code changes.
- Easy to integrate with existing Razor templates (render helpers can read schema).

**Cons:**
- Requires building or adopting a schema renderer.
- May limit highly custom UI/UX.

**Use When:**
- You want to empower non-devs to build dashboards, or need to automate dashboard creation at scale.

## Recommendation & Next Steps

- Review these options with your team and stakeholders.
- Consider your team's skills, maintenance needs, and long-term vision.
- Start with a proof-of-concept for your top 1–2 options.
- Document your decision and onboarding steps for future contributors.
