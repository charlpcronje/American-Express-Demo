# Build Process

> [Back to README](./README.md)


This document explains how the build process works for this React dashboard project.

## Steps

1. **Development:**
   - Run `npm start` to launch the development server.
   - Hot-reloads on file changes.

2. **Production Build:**
   - Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build.
   - Output goes to the `build/` directory.
   - Only files in the `public/` directory (e.g. images, data) are copied as-is.
   - All JS/CSS is minified and bundled.

3. **Serving the Build:**
   - Use `serve -s build` to serve the static site locally.
   - Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4. **Deploying:**
   - Upload the `build/` directory to your static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc).

## Key Points
- **Static Assets:** Only files in `public/` are copied to the build output.
- **Data:** Place test data in `public/data/`.
- **Images:** Place images in `public/images/`.
- **Do NOT reference images in `src/` with absolute paths.**

See `assets-and-testdata.md` for more on static assets.
